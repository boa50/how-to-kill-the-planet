        <h2 id="title">Electric Vehicles (EVs) sales have been increasing</h2>
        <h5 id="subtitle">
            Promoting EVs is an excellent way to put more strain on our world's climate change problems. We can also
            encourage them by saying that they are "sustainable", "green" and "good for our planet". And with everyone
            talking about it, our job becomes easier, making sure that public transport is not improved and that
            electric vehicles are the solution for our CO₂ emissions &#128516;

        <h2 id="title">Let's have more cars than people</h2>
        <h5 id="subtitle">
            We are doing well, buying as many cars as possible, even more than the increase of populations in the last 5
            years, making sure that we will have more cars than people in the future, and, by promoting EVs, we can make
            this happen even faster. Wealthier people replacing their cars with a "sustainable" one combined with
            reducing conventional car prices to make them accessible to everyone is the perfect formula to ensure more
            people will drive and push as much CO₂ as possible into the atmosphere.

        <h2 id="title">EVs produce more greenhouse gases in the short term</h2>
        <h5 id="subtitle">
            Electric cars bring the benefit of emitting more greenhouse gases during their production, mainly due to the
            batteries. As long as we buy cars, we will ensure the plan we came up with is accomplished. It is a way of
            increasing CO₂ emissions in a short period. And we can continue this flow by buying the newest and most
            technological models.

        <h2 id="title">EVs "compensate" their emissions over the years</h2>
        <h5 id="subtitle">
            We can also say that Electric Vehicles pay back their CO2 emissions. But we must drive more to compensate
            faster. So even though we produce more CO₂ and increase the world's emissions, we must promote the "quick
            payback" of emissions to ensure we are "sustainable".
