            Promoting EVs is an excellent way to put more strain in our world climate change problems. We
            can also promote saying that it is "green" "ecological" and "good for our plannet". And with everyone
            talking about it, our job becomes easier, making sure that public transport is not improved and that
            electric vehicles are the solution for our CO2 emissions :)

            We are doing well, buying as many cars as possible, even more than the increase of populations
            in the last 5 years, making sure that we well have more cars than people in the future and promoting the EVs
            we can make this happen even faster. Rich pepople replace their cars for an EV reducing combustion vehicles
            prices to make them accessible to everyone and with more people driving, we can push as much CO2 as possible
            in the atmosphere

            As long as we buy cars we are helping with our plan. Increase the CO2 emissions in a short
            period of time. And we can continue this flow by buying the newest and most technological models

            We can also say that Electric Vehicles pay back their CO2 emissions. But we must drive more to
            compensate faster. So even though we produce more CO2 and increase world's emissions, we must assure to
            promote the "fast pay back"
